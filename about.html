<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>First and foremost, I believe that it is most important to live with integrity. To me, integrity means to be impeccable with my word. Integrity, to me, also means dedication to see things through until completion. This applies to my work ethic as well as every area of my life. My dedication to living by these moral codes is not to be confused with the concept that I do not falter nor err in my ways. It means that I am focused and conscious of my convictions, which serves me well in my constant pursuit to make less mistakes.</p>

<p>I love to learn. That may sound cliche, but I truly mean it. I am a very fast learner, it comes easy to me, and I value knowledge and wisdom. This web development course is the very beginning of a step in the direction of working with computers and familiarizing myself with the internet and its many branches of operation. When I set my mind to learning and adopting a new skillset, I am extremely meticulous and unrelenting in my efforts. </p>

<p>Aside from my determination to excel in whatever I choose to focus my energy on, I am a loving father with a passion for helping and inspiring others. Some say my heart is too big for my own good, and sometimes, I have my suspiscions. I am a very family-oriented man. My eternal flame is ignited with my love for my children, my family, and all other living beings. I am not fast to pass judgement on someone, because I've likely messed up even worse than the next person. I have forgiven myself for all of my past mistakes, and though I don't dwell on them, I keep good mental note of them so as to not repeat the same mistakes. I truly believe that I am capable of excelling at whatever I set my mind on. Due to my ongoing competition with myself, I am forever evolving and honing my focus and skills towards wherever my heart leads me.</p>
